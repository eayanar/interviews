General
--- Sequence detector design (Overlapping and Non Overlapping)
--- How to fix HOLD violation on a tapedout chip?
CDC
--- Same Clock generated from various PLL1 and PLL2 . What kind of synchronisation is needed?
-------- How can this be handled without synchronisation
--- Is synchroniser needed between two subsystems of same clock?
-------- if needed what is the FIFO depth?
--- Variable rate of reads and writes. FIFO Depth calculation
STA
--- Max Critical path is  x seconds. Use that for a design with greater than or lesser than x seconds
