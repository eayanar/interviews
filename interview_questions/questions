General
--- Sequence detector design (Overlapping and Non Overlapping)
--- How to fix HOLD violation on a tapedout chip?

CDC
--- Same Clock generated from various PLL1 and PLL2 . What kind of synchronisation is needed?
-------- How can this be handled without synchronisation
--- Is synchroniser needed between two subsystems of same clock?
-------- if needed what is the FIFO depth?
--- Variable rate of reads and writes. FIFO Depth calculation
STA
--- Max Critical path is  x seconds. Use that for a design with greater than or lesser than x seconds
Others
--- How will you do coefficient multiplicaltions in RTL. Eg: x*10

RESET synchroniser design and the Metastability problems
- Do second FF in reset synch go to metastabilty?

Design FIFO for

 input rate of 80 per 100 clock 
 read rate of 8/10 clock ... Derive the maximum FIFO depth needed

A block get two clock CLOCK_B and CLOCK_C which are derived from input CLOCK_A. CLOCK_B and CLOCK_C are divide by 2 clocks from CLOCK_A. CLOCK_B has more logic associated with it.
